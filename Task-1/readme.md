### Things to do :

○ Remove any duplicate entries.
○ Handle missing values (you can choose to fill them with a default value or
drop the rows).
○ Convert the JoiningDate column to a proper datetime format.
○ Filter out employees who are no longer working (where Status is
'Resigned').

2. Analysis: After cleaning the data, perform the following:
○ Find the average salary of employees in each department.
○ List all employees who joined after the year 2020.
4. Expected Output: Submit a cleaned DataFrame and the results of your analysis.
